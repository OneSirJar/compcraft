# Chest Monitor

This project will allow you to view the contents of an adjacent chest using a monitor. This can be used without any coding knowledge, though comments that briefly explain the overall functions of certain lines of code are included.

## Installation

1. Download the `install.lua` file to your in-game computer using the Pastebin `get` command.

   ```
   wget run
   https://github.com/OneSirJar/compcraft/blob/main/install.lua
   ```

2. Run the `install.lua` script to install the necessary files. This script will automatically download the files from the compcraft GitHub repository.

## Usage

Once chest_monitor.lua is installed, you should be able to view chest contents on a monitor! This can be tinkered with within a computer crafted/spawned via the Computercraft mod.
